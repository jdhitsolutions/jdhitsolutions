<img src="images/MVP-Logo-small.png" alt="MVP" align="left" style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px;"> I am a veteran IT Pro and scripting fanatic, going back to batch files in the early days of DOS. Today, I create content, code, and courses intended to teach PowerShell or to make an IT Pro's job a little easier. You can often find me speaking to user groups and at IT conferences like the PowerShell Summit. You can learn about me and find links to all of my online activities, including a premium newsletter devoted to mastering PowerShell at [https://jdhitsolutions.github.io](https://jdhitsolutions.github.io).

Here are the latest issues from the [newsletter](https://jdhitsolutions.com/yourls/newsletter):

## :bulb: Current Work

<img src = "images/scriptingguy.png" alt="scripting guy" style="float: left; padding: 0px 10px 10px 10px;" align="left"> The list below includes some of my current GitHub projects that I think will be of interest to most IT professionals. I write these modules not only to solve common problems or add value to your daily work routine but also to serve as teaching opportunities. As you might expect, much of my work is PowerShell-related, and most modules can be installed from the PowerShell Gallery. You can find all of my repositories by clicking the [Repositories](https://github.com/jdhitsolutions?tab=repositories) link.

You might also find useful bits of information in my GitHub [gists](https://gist.github.com/jdhitsolutions).

## :book: Books and Courses :mortar_board:

In addition to the well-known [_Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches_](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-windows-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches-third-edition?a_aid=jdhit&a_bid=2326a8ab) book, you can find my other work on Leanpub.

| ----- | ------------ |
| ![Behind the PowerShell Pipeline](images/psbehind-book.png) | [_Behind the PowerShell Pipeline_](https://jdhitsolutions.com/yourls/psbehind) is a guide to writing PowerShell code that is human-centered. It is about the intangible parts of PowerShell that you should keep in mind when using it or writing code.|
| ![PowerShell PracticePrimer](images/psprimer-thumb.png) | [_The PowerShell Practice Primer_](https://leanpub.com/psprimer) isn't a book to teach you PowerShell, but rather to re-enforce what you already know through 100+ console-based exercises. No scripting is required. No lab setups. Updated with PowerShell 7.x content.|
| ![PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking](images/pstoolmaking-thumbnail.png) | If you have read [_Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches_](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-scripting-in-a-month-of-lunches?a_aid=jdhit&a_bid=2326a8ab), then you are ready for the next step. Don Jones and I wrote this book intending it to be the definitive guide on everything you need to know to be a better PowerShell scripter and toolmaker. |
| ![pluralsight](images/ps-skills-thumb.jpg) | I have been creating video training courses for over ten years. I have a large course catalog at [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/qbR6n), with an emphasis on PowerShell-related content. If you are just getting started with PowerShell 7, [I got you covered](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/Lbvya) there as well.|

<img src = "images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg" alt="ms powershell" style="float: right; padding: 5px 0px 0px 0px;" align="right"> There is a wealth of code on GitHub. These are a few recommendations for PowerShell-related repositories. Many of these people have published modules in the PowerShell Gallery.
